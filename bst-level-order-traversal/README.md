# BST Level Order Traversal

URL - https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-binary-trees/

A level-order traversal, also known as a breadth-first search, visits each level of a tree's nodes from left to right, top to bottom. You are given a pointer, **_root_** , pointing to the root of a binary search tree. Complete the levelOrder function provided in your editor so that it prints the level-order traversal of the binary search tree.

## Output Format

Print the _data_ value of each node in the tree's level-order traversal as a single line _N_ of space-separated integers
