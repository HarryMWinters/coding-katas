A prime is a natural number greater than **1** that has no positive divisors other than and itself. Given a number, **n**, determine and print whether it's **Prime** or **Not prime**.

Note: If possible, try to come up with a _O(sqrt(N)_ primality algorithm, or see what sort of optimizations you come up with for an _O(n)_ algorithm. Be sure to check out the Editorial after submitting your code!

## Function Description

Take a integer _n_ and return True if prime, else false.

## Constraints

- 1 <= _n_ <= 2\*10^9

## Output Format

A lorem ispum dolor data struct.
