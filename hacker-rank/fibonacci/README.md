# Fibonacci

URL - https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/fibonacci/problem

The Fibonacci sequence appears in nature all around us, in the arrangement of seeds in a sunflower and the spiral of a nautilus for example.

The Fibonacci sequence begins with `fibonacci(0) = 0` and `fibonacci(1) = 1` as its first and second terms. After these first two elements, each subsequent element is equal to the sum of the previous two elements.

Given **n**, return the nth element of the fibonacci sequence.

## Constraints

- 0 <= **n** <= 30
