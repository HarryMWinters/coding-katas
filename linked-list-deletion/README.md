# Linked List Deletion

URL - https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-linked-list-deletion/problem

Task
A Node class is provided for you in the editor. A Node object has an integer data field, **_data_**, and a Node instance pointer, **_next_**, pointing to another node (i.e.: the next node in a list).

A removeDuplicates function is declared in your editor, which takes a pointer to the _**head**_ node of a linked list as a parameter. Complete removeDuplicates so that it deletes any duplicate nodes from the list and returns the head of the updated list.

Note: The **_head_** pointer may be null, indicating that the list is empty. Be sure to reset your **_next_** pointer when performing deletions to avoid breaking the list.
